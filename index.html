			<h3> About Me </h3>

			 <p> Hey, I am Sandesh Jain a "Full Stack Developer" by profession. Currently I am pursuing my Bachelors degree in the Computer Science Stream from Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology & Sciences, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India. </p>
			 
			 <p> I am passionate towards Full Stack Development. I have learned this skill during COVID-19 lockdown with one of my dear friend "Swapnil Nema" under a skilled guider "Uday Rajoriya". </p> 

			 <p> Under his guidence I started working on this skill and I found that I was investing my time & efforts in the right direction and I kept on practicing regularly and beacause of that my confidence level has increased. Then I decided to choose my carrier in this field. And now I have started making projects with my friends and I am also trying to make a project by my own. </p>

			 <p> Currently me and my friends are working on a project called "URL SHORTNER". Our objective for this project was to create a service that can be used by end users to shorten a complex URL into something that can be easily transmitted, shared or even remembered. </p>

			 <p> My role in this project is as a back-end developer. I am responsible for creating "Signup" modules's backend using "PHP", that includes storing the user information into our database when a user sign's up for our service.  
			 I am also responsible for creating the back-end of the update module of dashboard with which a user can modify his or her information. </p>
